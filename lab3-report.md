# Using `grep` in the command line

Grep is a command line argument that is used to search through files for a specific pattern. It will display any lines in the file that match the pattern given in the command line. The basic usage for grep is as follows: `grep (argument 1) (argument 2)`. In this case, (argument 1) is the patter that you are looking for and (argument 2) is the file that you want to search in. Additionally, there are many options that can be used to modify the behavior of grep in the command line. 

## Option 1: `grep -i`
One option is -i which searches for lines that matches the pattern given regardless of whether it is uppercase or lowercase. 
An example of using this command with string search data is shown below. Using grep -i will show all of the lines in the file jounal.pbio.0020001.txt that have the word science in it even if it is upper/lowercase. This is useful because it helps to find any string regardless of case.

command: `grep -i "science" journal.pbio.0020001.txt`

Here is another example. In this one, I am searching for the word "diversity" in the file diversity_priorities.txt. This is helpful because I want to see where it mentions diversity, not caring about whether it is uppercase or not.

command: `grep -i "diversity" diversity_priorities.txt`

output: `national conference on diversity in the legal services community.

## Option 2: `grep -v`
Another option is `grep -v` which inverts the search and shows the lines that do not match the pattern. 
One example of using this command with the string search data is as shown below. This grep command using -v will show all of the lines in the file chapter-1.txt (which is in the 911report directory) that do not contain the string 'the'. This is useful in any scenario where you want to find lines that do not contain a certain string, since this might be easier than searching for the string itself: 

command: `grep -v "the" chapter-1.txt`

output: `"WE HAVE SOME PLANES"

What If?`

Another example is as follows. This command will search the file 1468-6708-3-1.txt which is in the biomed directory and find all of the lines that do not contain the letter a: `grep -v "a" 1468-6708-3-1.txt`

## Option 3: `grep -e`
Another option is -e which can be used to search for multiple patterns in one search at the command line. This command can be very helpful when you want to narrow down your search in the files more than just down to one pattern. `grep` will print out the lines if it finds matches for any of the patterns provided.
An example of using this is shown below. In this case, I am searching the file DraftRecom-PDF.txt for two different strings ("recommendation" and "address"). It is much easier and more efficient to do this than searching for the patterns separately.

command: `grep -e "recommendations" -e "address" DraftRecom-PDF.txt`

output: `recommendations from conference deliberations. Before the

Another example is shown below for this command. In this example, I am searching for the words drinking and anxiety in the file Session2-PDF.txt. 

command: `grep -e "drinking" -e "anxiety" Session2-PDF.txt`

output: `disease develops. WHO defines hazardous drinking as 4 or more

## Option 4: `grep -c`
Another option is -c which returns the number of lines that match the pattern provided in the command line. It does not display the lines itself, but rather a single integer. This command is useful when you do not want the actual lines themselves but just want to know how many times a certain pattern is present in a file.
One example is as shown below. Here, I am looking for how many lines in the file 1468-6708-3-4.txt for how many lines contain the word "death" and it returned 10. 

command: `grep -c "death" 1468-6708-3-4.txt`

output: `10`

Another example is shown below. In this case, I want to see how many lines in the file 1471-213X-1-10.txt contain the word "gene". 

command: `grep -c "gene" 1471-213X-1-10.txt`

output: `99`

I found out about the options of the grep command in two ways. One was through this website [Link](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html). The other way was by asking ChatGPT!
