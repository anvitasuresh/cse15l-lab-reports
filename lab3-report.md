Grep is a command line argument that is used to search through files for a specific pattern. It will display any lines in the file that match the pattern given in the command line. There are many options that can be used to modify the behavior of grep in the command line. 
1. One option is -c which provides the count of the lines that match the pattern provided and not the actual lines.
2. Another option is -v which inverts the search and shows the lines that do not match the pattern.
3. Another is -e which can be used to search for multiple patterns in one search at the command line.
4. Another is -C which shows the lines before and after the line where the pattern matches.
