# Using `grep` in the command line

Grep is a command line argument that is used to search through files for a specific pattern. It will display any lines in the file that match the pattern given in the command line. The basic usage for grep is as follows: `grep (argument 1) (argument 2)`. In this case, (argument 1) is the patter that you are looking for and (argument 2) is the file that you want to search in. Additionally, there are many options that can be used to modify the behavior of grep in the command line. 

## Option 1: `grep -i`
One option is -i which searches for lines that matches the pattern given regardless of whether it is uppercase or lowercase. 
An example of using this command with string search data is shown below. Using grep -i will show all of the lines in the file jounal.pbio.0020001.txt that have the word science in it even if it is upper/lowercase. This is useful because it helps to find any string regardless of case.
`grep -i "science" journal.pbio.0020001.txt`

Here is another example. In this one, I am searching for the word "diversity" in the file diversity_priorities.txt. This is helpful because I want to see where it mentions diversity, not caring about whether it is uppercase or not.
`grep -i "diversity" diversity_priorities.txt`

## Option 2: `grep -v`
Another option is `grep -v` which inverts the search and shows the lines that do not match the pattern. 
One example of using this command with the string search data is as shown below. This grep command using -v will show all of the lines in the file chapter-1.txt (which is in the 911report directory) that do not contain the string 'the'. This is useful in any scenario where you want to find lines that do not contain a certain string, since this might be easier than searching for the string itself: 
`grep -v "the" chapter-1.txt`

    Between 6:45 and 7:40, Atta and Omari, along with Satam al Suqami, Wail al Shehri, and Waleed al Shehri, checked in and boarded American Airlines Flight 11, bound for Los Angeles. The flight was scheduled to depart at 7:45.

Another example is as follows. This command will search the file 1468-6708-3-1.txt which is in the biomed directory and find all of the lines that do not contain the letter a: `grep -v "a" 1468-6708-3-1.txt`

## Option 3: `grep -e`
Another option is -e which can be used to search for multiple patterns in one search at the command line. This command can be very helpful when you want to narrow down your search in the files more than just down to one pattern. 
An example of using this is shown below. In this case, I am searching the file DraftRecom-PDF.txt for two different strings ("recommendation" and "address"). It is much easier and more efficient to do this than searching for the patterns separately.
`grep -e "recommendations" -e "address" DraftRecom-PDF.txt`
`

## Option 4: `grep -C`
Another option is -C which shows the lines before and after the line where the pattern matches.
